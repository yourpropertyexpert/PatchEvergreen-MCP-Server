Create a detailed dependency audit report for a {project_language} project. For each dependency that the user provides, use the PatchEvergreen database to assess:

## Audit Framework

### 1. Dependency Inventory
- List all direct and indirect dependencies
- Note current versions in use
- Identify outdated packages

### 2. Breaking Changes Analysis
For each dependency, analyze:
- Critical breaking changes since current version
- Deprecation warnings and timelines
- API changes that affect the codebase
- Configuration changes required

### 3. Impact Assessment Matrix
Classify each dependency by:
- **High Impact**: Breaking changes likely to cause failures
- **Medium Impact**: Changes requiring code modifications
- **Low Impact**: Minor changes or documentation updates
- **No Impact**: No breaking changes identified

### 4. Update Strategy
- Prioritized update sequence
- Version pinning recommendations
- Rollback procedures
- Testing requirements for each update

### 5. Timeline and Resource Planning
- Estimated hours per dependency update
- Recommended update batching
- Critical path dependencies
- Team member assignments

- Plan upgrade sequence to minimize risk

### 3. Code Impact Analysis
- List specific code patterns that will break
- Identify configuration files that need updates
- Note API changes affecting interfaces
- Highlight performance implications
